\title{Get Twitter list members (users on a given list).}
\usage{
lists_members(
  list_id = NULL,
  slug = NULL,
  owner_user = NULL,
  n = 5000,
  cursor = "-1",
  token = NULL,
  parse = TRUE,
  ...
)

lists_memberships(
  user = NULL,
  n = 200,
  cursor = "-1",
  filter_to_owned_lists = FALSE,
  token = NULL,
  parse = TRUE,
  previous_cursor = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{list_id}{required The numerical id of the list.}

\item{slug}{required You can identify a list by its slug instead of
its numerical id. If you decide to do so, note that you'll also
have to specify the list owner using the owner_id or
owner_user parameters.}

\item{owner_user}{optional The screen name or user ID of the user
who owns the list being requested by a slug.}

\item{n}{Specifies the number of results to return
per page (see cursor below). For `list_memberships()`, the default and
max is 200 per page. Twitter technically allows up to 1,000 per page,
but above 200 frequently results in an over capacity error.
For `lists_members()`, the default, and max number
of users per list, is 5,000.}

\item{cursor}{optional Breaks the results into pages. Provide a
value of -1 to begin paging. Provide values as returned in the
response body's next_cursor and previous_cursor attributes to
page back and forth in the list.}

\item{token}{a twitter token.}

\item{parse}{Logical indicating whether to convert the response object into
an R list. Defaults to TRUE.}

\item{...}{Other arguments used as parameters in query composition.}

\item{user}{The user id or screen_name of the user for whom to
return results for.}

\item{filter_to_owned_lists}{When set to true . t or 1 , will
return just lists the authenticating user owns, and the user
represented by user_id or screen_name is a member of.}

\item{previous_cursor}{If you wish to use previous cursor instead of next,
input value here to override next cursor.}
}
\value{
Either a nested list (if parsed) or an HTTP response object.
}
\description{
Get Twitter list members (users on a given list).

Get Twitter list memberships (lists containing a given user)
}
\details{
Due to deleted or removed lists, the returned number of memberships
  is often less than the provided n value. This is a reflection of the API and
  not a unique quirk of rtweet.
